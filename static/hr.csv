"
   Why should we hire you?," I have always loved the world of fashion and your company is one of the most respected fashion houses in the country.I started my career as an Accountant then went back to school part-time to study Fashion Design. Four years later I made a career switch starting out at the very bottom of the fashion career ladder.Through my hard work, efforts and tenacity I have risen through the ranks in a relatively short period and I now support the digital content department for a leading fashion magazine.I have come up with concepts that have helped us reach previously ignored customer groups hence increasing subscriptions and revenues.I have even written fashion articles during my free time that have been featured in upcoming fashion blogs and magazines.I am known for working tirelessly to meet editorial deadlines and ensure that I am supporting my colleagues appropriately.

Since before I can remember, I’ve prided myself on being a creative person myself.

I’m excited to think how my creativity and ambition could enhance what’s already great here. !@#@!  I have a passion for application development that’s grown stronger over the course of my five-year career.

I have a good experience in that particular field (field of your specialization), and I think my talents will be a big contribution to the continuing pursuit of excellence of your company. "
   What are your major strengths?," I am organized, dependable and responsive.As an Executive Assistant to three very busy Vice Presidents, each of my work days is different and more challenging than the previous one.I ensure that all the VP’s calendars and appointments are properly booked, prepare draft presentations and reports on technical information, write and circulate accurate minutes in a timely manner and make local and international travel arrangements.I even stay up late at night to put out fires across different time zones when a VP is stranded in a foreign country that is 12 hours ahead of us or has last minute schedule adjustments.My supervisors have come to trust and depend on me for all their administrative needs and I have received numerous accolades from them over the past few years.They have made it known across the company about how satisfied and happy they are with my work. I am eager to bring this same level of passion and results to this position.  !@#@! I believe one of my greatest strengths is time management. For example, last semester I managed to earn a 3.8 GPA while working 20 hours a week at a local coffee shop, serving as president of my fraternity, and acting as a teaching assistant for a freshman writing course. I’m also very organized and detail-oriented. !@#@!  I’m a natural problem solver. I find it rewarding to dig deep and uncover solutions to challenges. It’s like solving a puzzle. It’s something I’ve always excelled at and something I enjoy. Much of product development is about finding innovative solutions to challenging issues, which is what drew me to this career path in the first place.  !@#@!  My main strengths are the ability to use my initiative to take on challenges. I am always proactive at what I do, and that keeps my mind stimulated and focused.  !@#@!  My greatest strengths would be my intelligence and thoughtfulness. I believe that in every work environment you need to process every step and be detailed in your work.   !@#@!  My time management skills are excellent, and I'm organized, efficient, and take pride in excelling at my work.  !@#@!  I always understand the value of time, and I am always able to innovate. I listen to advice from others.   !@#@!  My greatest strength is my ability to focus on my work. I'm not easily distracted, and this means that my performance is very high.  !@#@!  My biggest strength is my Confidence. Apart from that, I am Hardworking, self-motivated with a positive attitude towards my career and my life. If I have a problem, then I think its an opportunity for me to express my ability.  "
   What are your major weaknesses?," One of my weaknesses is being too quiet and socially shy. My supervisor even pointed this out as an area for improvement during one of my past performance reviews.She mentioned that it was very important for me to network and form strong social bonds with staff from other departments and I was challenged to attend more company-wide activities and proactively interact with others.Although it has not been a matter of flipping a switch and making an instant transformation from being quiet to an extrovert, I have been taking baby steps and putting myself out there, interacting more with others, striking up conversations, participating in company activities, volunteering in events such as organizing staff baby showers and planning birthday celebrations.As a result of these efforts colleagues from other departments are gradually warming up to me and I have even been invited to participate in a few highly visible cross-departmental projects.  !@#@! I’m an organized person, so I have trouble with last-minute changes and ambiguity. In school, I scheduled out all my work, but in an office environment, deadlines and priorities are always shifting. So, I’m working to get more accustomed to those changes. I’m taking an online class in project management, and it’s helped me make room for changing priorities. Now, if a last-minute change crops up, I know how to reprioritize. !@#@!  I sometimes have trouble saying ‘no’ and end up overwhelmed by my workload. Earlier in my career, I would take on so many projects that I’d work evenings and weekends. It was stressful. I realised this was counterproductive so I started using workload management tools and setting better expectations for myself and my teammates.  !@#@!  You can say,  I used to be very disorganized, always forgetting assignments and birthdays. But I managed to work out a computerized system of to-do lists and reminders that keep me on top of everything.  !@#@!  I am a straightforward person, and I cannot say no when someone asks me for help. "
   What are your major accomplishments?," One of my greatest and proudest accomplishments is successfully planning and executing two major events within one month of starting a new job.This happened three years ago when I was hired as an Events Coordinator at Company XYZ.During my first week on the job my boss informed me that we should plan for two high profile events which were to be held back-to-back, one day apart, within a month’s time.The meetings were to be held at two separate venues 60 miles apart.The following few weeks were a frenzy of activity. I was a new employee trying to figure out the telephone codes and at the same time calling and inviting key business leaders to attend one of our events.On the other hand I was booking hotel venues, securing accommodation for participants, discussing menu preferences, making transport arrangements, preparing name tags, preparing and printing meeting materials, and assembling printouts and meeting materials into binders for two separate events simultaneously.In addition, I was handling requests from the meeting facilitators, following up with participants who had not RSVP’d and also regularly updating my boss on how everything was coming along.It was a whirlwind of activity within a short time frame and I was doing all this alone with expert guidance from my boss.The two events went off successfully with over 100 participants attending. Although I was exhausted at the end of it all, I felt very happy about the accomplishment. "
   What are your educational qualifications?," I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Journalism from XYZ University and I graduated five years ago.I decided to do journalism because since I was a kid I was fascinated by news reporters on Television.I wanted to be either a newscaster or a news reporter. In college I was also fortunate enough to learn fluent French so now I can not only report news in English but also in French.During my senior year I did an internship at a local TV station where I shadowed a news reporter for three months.It was a very intense and exciting experience especially during times when she was covering breaking news.I got the chance to ask the reporter many questions about her work experience, tips for success, words of wisdom, how to speak off the cuff confidently and also got a chance to practice talking in front of the camera.This experience solidified my resolve to pursue a career as a news reporter. "
   Why are you leaving your current job?," After four years in my current position, I feel that it is the right time for me to progress in my career. I am seeking more challenge and growth.I am proud of what I have been able to accomplish in my current role specifically adding new high net-worth customer accounts and supporting the rolling out of a new customer management system.I have grown as a professional and learnt new skills that will help me going forward.I have also solidified my analytical and negotiating skills and I’m able to handle a larger volume of customer accounts.I believe that this new position is a good fit for me and I look forward to this company being the new home for my skills and expertise.  !@#@!  I’m looking for an opportunity that gives me the ability to build closer, long-term relationships with clients. In my current role, the sales cycle is so short that I don’t spend as much time building a rapport with my customers as I’d like. Relationship-building is one of the reasons I chose a career in sales and I look forward to working with a company in which that’s a top priority.  !@#@!  Sir, it's a career move. I have learned a lot from my last job, but now I am looking for new challenges to broaden my horizons and to gain a new skill-set. "
"   Where do you see yourself in the future – in 5 years, 10 years etc?"," I see myself growing and advancing in my career over the next few years.I envision performing at a higher level to meet and even exceed my performance goals.I envision performing my job at a progressively higher level with more responsibilities.  !@#@! In five years, I see myself here at XYZ Company, contributing to the team and adding value for the branch. I love that you offer so many opportunities for professional development, and I want to grow with the company. So, I plan to master my role as an assistant in the next few years, and hopefully become an associate after that. !@#@!  In five years, I’d like to be an industry expert in my field with the ability to train and mentor students and entry-level designers. I would also like to gain specialised knowledge in user experience to be a well-rounded contributor working with design and marketing teams on large scale projects that make a difference in the company and to the global community. "
  What are you looking for in a job?," I like a job where I have the freedom to be creative and perform my work with little or minimum supervision.I thrive in work environments where teams are highly collaborative and enjoy the brainstorming process to put forth ideas, distill them and refine them further to come up with greater and stronger concepts.This is why I am attracted to this job and this company because it has a history and strong company values that support employee creativity and collaboration.  !@#@! I’m an experienced writer, who loves what she does. And I’m looking for an opportunity to utilize my strong writing and editing skills to craft compelling messages. I was especially drawn to the cross-industry clients you support, as it will allow me to flex my writing muscles and work on a diversity of projects at once. I know it will be busy, but I also know it will be exciting. !@#@!  I’ve been passionate about user experience design for most of my professional career. I was excited to see this company uses Adobe products because I’m well versed in the entire suite. Also, I’m a huge advocate for applying agile workflows to design. I think it’s the most effective way to tackle large projects. I was able to successfully build and launch an agile process in my previous role as UX manager and we saw considerable improvements in project speed. "
  What are your hobbies or interests outside work?," My top hobbies are jogging and cooking.I enjoy talking long jogs in the evening at least three times a week.I like breathing in the cool evening air and watching the different color glows as the sun sets.Jogging calms and relaxes me and gets me ready to face a new day full of energy.I also enjoy cooking. I especially relish the challenge of learning a new recipe and trying it out.It usually takes a couple of tries before I perfect a recipe and it is such a gratifying feeling once the meal comes together perfectly.I can sit back with the satisfaction of knowing that I now have one more recipe up my sleeve.  !@#@! One of my favorite hobbies is running. I try to run every day and run about ten 5Ks a year. It helps me relax and get outside of my head.

  What did you like most about your last job?," In my previous job as a Website Designer, I enjoyed the challenge of creatively transforming a client’s idea into a fully functioning website.I liked the opportunity to sit down with a client, listen to their ideas and requirements then design a website mock-up within a day or two.It was insightful going back and forth with the client tweaking the mock-up until both of us were on the same page.After that, I enjoyed the autonomy of designing the website and giving the client fully functioning drafts ahead of schedule "

  What is your greatest career achievement?," I am most proud of creating a user friendly, easy to use, multi-year budget template.When I started my last job as a Budgets Manager, one of the major challenges was a lack of a consistent budget format, budget template and an easy to understand template.The existing budget template was so complicated that over time different departments had started to creatively use their own versions of budgets leading to inconsistency throughout the organization during budgeting period.I reviewed all the different formats, talked to key users about their preferences and created from scratch a simple budget template that could not only be used for annual budgeting but could also be used for five year budget forecasts.I rolled out the template to all offices and trained staff on how to use it.Within two years the whole company was using one standard budget template which saved so much time for all managers and the accounting department during the annual budgeting season.

"
  Which of your former jobs did you like most and why?," The job that I liked the most was working as a long distance/interstate Truck Driver at company XYZ for three years.I enjoyed the freedom to work independently. Once I had my pick-up and delivery schedules, my supervisors trusted me to meet delivery times with regularity.I enjoyed the freedom of driving on the open highways and also liked meeting new people – customers, suppliers, vendors and other truck drivers.Most of all was the satisfaction of knowing that I played a key part in transporting essential everyday commodities manufacturers and distributors to the consumers. "
  Which of your former bosses did you like most and why?," Out of all my former bosses, my most favorite one was a Principal at a High School.I used to work as a History teacher and what I liked most about the Principal was her ability to give good directions.She also had a big vision for both the students and the teachers and was willing to make time to regularly meet all teachers and brainstorm ways to improve learning and achievement in the school.Her leadership was very inspiring, collaborative and at the same time held everyone accountable for achieving high results. "
  Give an example of your leadership skills?," When I was working as a Receptionist at Company XYZ, I noticed that one of the challenges that staff used to have was overspending on the allocated budget for working lunch as well as the amount of time wasted as staff agonized over ordering group meals.There were many working lunch meetings during the year in that company.I took it upon myself to visit all the restaurants that were near the office and requested for copies of their menus.I also talked to the Restaurant Managers about priority delivery options and requested for a specific contact person who we could call on short notice to ensure that our food order was prepared and delivered quickly.I also negotiated discounts for repeat large orders throughout the year.I then compiled a spreadsheet that showed all the different restaurants in the neighborhood, contact persons, telephone numbers, food prices, discounts offered and different menu items, photos of the meals as well as estimated delivery times based on when the orders were placed.I uploaded this detailed and searchable spreadsheet on the company’s intranet and sent an email to all staff about it.I also organized a meeting and walked everyone through the spreadsheet and answered questions from staff.All staff had to do was to simply send me in advance the meeting date, time, conference room, number of participants and choice of food and I would place the order.This process helped in planning, saving costs and saving time and my colleagues were very happy to use the resource.After implementing this new system for one year, only 80% of the allocated working lunch budget was spent compared to the previous years where an average of 120% of the budget was spent. "

I like to include my team, colleagues and boss in planning and brainstorming meetings to solicit their input, ideas and suggestions.Once everyone’s input has been sought, I am comfortable making a decision and assigning tasks and milestones to team members.I follow-up my team’s progress through regular check in meetings to ensure that everything is progressing well according to schedule.I encourage my team to let me know in advance about significant potential problems and challenges so that we can iron them out in good time.I also offer regular feedback and genuine praise and recognition to team members to encourage them to maintain and even exceed their high performance standards. "

Now, I still get nervous before pitches, but I have learned how to remain calm and get the job done right.  !@#@!  As you know that I have never worked in my life and this is my first job, my inexperience is my weakness. But I beg to differ. I am confident and a fast learner.

  How do you handle conflict at work?," One of the challenges I faced recently was working with a colleague who often did not copy me on emails regarding projects and deadlines we were collaborating on.Instead he would mention upcoming deadlines during weekly team meetings and by then there would be little time left to meet the deadlines.This caused me anxiety because I did not have a clear picture of pending tasks.Consequently, I could not plan my work well and often was blindsided by urgent deadlines.In those cases I had to drop everything I was working on to meet the deadlines.I decided to schedule a meeting with my colleague to discuss this situation.I mentioned that it was important to include me on relevant email chains so that I could get an early heads up on deadlines.I elaborated that this would help me to prioritize my tasks and deliver high quality work ahead of schedule.My colleague said that he had assumed mentioning upcoming projects and deadlines during the once a week team meeting was sufficient notice.I pointed out that with many other tasks that were on my plate it would be helpful to get an email as soon as a project and deadline was assigned rather than waiting till the team meeting.After the meeting, my colleague started to include me on relevant email chains.I made an effort to thank my colleague each time he cc’d me on an email and eventually we had a smoother working relationship. "
  How do you deal with change?," One day in my previous job as a Financial Coordinator, our Vice President of Finance announced that the company would be purchasing a new Financial Management System.This system would automate the finance and accounting processes and responsibilities and significantly change the way we were used to working.There was nervousness and apprehension within the team over what a new system would do.The VP of Finance invited team members to volunteer in evaluating and watching demos from different software vendors.I volunteered to participate in the evaluation committee and got a chance to ask questions about different aspects of the proposed systems with an aim to seeing which one had the best functions to support our company’s needs.I also watched online videos and tutorials about the different systems.I further contributed in providing suggestions and recommendations for the financial management system which I thought would best serve our needs.After the system was purchased and implementation began, based on the tutorials I had taken, I was able to quickly master the functions of the system.I even trained my colleagues on how to use the new system.The new system made our team more efficient and reduced many manual processes. "
  How do you handle constructive criticism?, I have regular one-on-one weekly meetings with my supervisor where I proactively request for constructive criticisms with an aim of improving my work performance.I welcome constructive feedback because it helps me to take steps to correct and improve upon areas where I fall short of expectations. 
  How would you describe your working style?," My most dominant work style revolves around how I structure and execute my daily tasks, how I interact and collaborate with colleagues and how I support and report back to my boss.I am a great believer in preparing to-do lists at the end of the day so that I can get a head start when I start work in the morning.This gives me an advantage because each morning I have a mental picture of what I will be working on.I can further prioritize my activities based on upcoming deadlines and reorganize my tasks to accommodate emergencies.I also enjoy contributing to team meetings with my colleagues especially brainstorming sessions where we are working on a new idea or solving a problem.I have scheduled a recurring 10 am daily check-in meeting with my boss where I brief her on my priorities for the day, report back on completed tasks for the previous day and inquire about my boss’ priorities for the day. "
  What motivates you?," I am motivated by doing creative and challenging work. As a Licensed Plumber, each maintenance service and repair call differs from the other.I like the process of diagnosing a customer’s problem, recommending an appropriate solution and then getting to work to execute the solution once it is approved by the customer.My greatest satisfaction is when a customer smiles with pleasure from the outstanding job that I have done.I always go above and beyond to deliver high quality service within the shortest amount of time while adhering to building codes.I ensure to leave the work area clean or cleaner than I found it.  !@#@!  Making a true difference in the lives of my patients and their families motivates me to strive for excellence in everything I do. I look forward to seeing my patients’ reaction when we get a positive outcome that will change their lives forever. That’s why I became a nurse and why I’m pursuing a position in pediatrics. "
  Do you prefer working alone or as part of a team?," I like working both independently and as part of a team.There are certain tasks that I function much better when working alone such as planning my work, writing reports, conducting research, doing sales calls and creative writing.I am also able to work well and collaborate with team members in various ways such as getting input from colleagues, getting a second opinion, brainstorming and generally supporting each other in achieving departmental goals.  !@#@! I love working on a team. When I interned with XYZ Company, there were issues with a few fellow interns not getting along. I intervened, organized a social gathering for the group, and it really helped them put their differences aside. We finished the summer on a great note and came up with the best ideas by putting our heads together. At the same time, I enjoy working independently when necessary. In school, I prided myself on never missing an essay deadline. That was because I’m able to put my head down and focus."
  Give examples of your teamwork contributions," I enjoy working in teams. I always enthusiastically offer my support to help in achieving shared goals.For example in one of my roles as an Event Coordinator, our team was tasked with planning a conference in a foreign country.We had a series of planning meetings and I was assigned the role of selecting the best possible conference venue within a limited budget.I started contacting different venues and regularly reported back to the team on the progress made.After numerous phone calls and emails I narrowed down the choice to three venues, presented the choices to the team and outlined the advantages and disadvantages of each.This helped the team in selecting the final venue which turned out to be a positive experience for the conference participants. "
  What major problem have you solved at work?," Two years ago when I was working as a Project Manager at Company XYZ, we received an email from one of our major donors that a final report for a five-year project was due within one week.Instead of writing the five-year report over a typical three month period, I now had only one week to write it.I quickly reorganized my tasks and made the report my highest priority.I swiftly developed a report outline, then reviewed previous progress reports, interviewed program implementers and wrote the report incorporating results and project outcomes achieved.It was a hectic week. After working fast and furiously, I was able to complete and submit the final report on time.This experience helped us to strengthen our project deadlines monitoring system.It turned out later that there was an error made when entering the final report deadline in the system where the wrong year had been keyed-in and we thought the report was due within one year.To prevent the problem from occurring again, I implemented a dual entry control system to ensure that one person keyed in a report due date and another person approved the due date in the system after double-checking the date against the awarded contract terms. "
  What is your biggest mistake at work and what did you learn?," Early on in my career, I was working as an Administrative Coordinator at a local manufacturing company.A few months into the job, my boss and I organized an offsite training workshop for all the departmental staff.We had contracted an international workshop facilitator who came to train our staff for three days.The facilitator used many flip charts where he wrote a myriad of concepts, processes, procedures and solutions that would help our team to be more productive and efficient.Once the workshop was over I was tasked with packing the workshop materials and returning them to the office.I packed up the materials such as projectors, folders, programs, evaluation sheets etc.However, when it came to the flip charts, and there were six flip charts that the instructor had written on, I decided to tear up those flip charts and threw them away because they were bulky and had been used.The next day my boss asked me to transcribe all the materials that were on the flip charts and prepare a report to circulate to all the departmental staff as well as to upload a copy of the report to the company’s intranet.I simply froze upon this request. I then told my boss that I had made a big mistake.I apologized and informed him that I had torn up the flip charts and threw them away at the workshop venue.My boss almost cried. He could not believe what I had done. He told me to figure out a way to correct the situation.I had to go around asking everyone who attended the workshop for their notes.I photocopied as many notes as possible and recreated the facilitator’s notes for the workshop report and for the company’s knowledge library.Since that time I have learnt to be very alert and careful as well as double-check with my manager when in doubt about something. "
  What is the greatest challenge you have faced at work?," One of the greatest challenges that I have faced at work has been situations where I have been left out of the loop of important communication that was necessary to enable me to do my tasks properly.Typically the root of the problem has been a communication issue.To avoid this kind of problem from occurring, I make an effort to early on build relationships with colleagues especially on critical teams where there is great need for collaboration.I do regular meetings and seek to find out what is coming down the pipeline to get advance warning or heads-up.I also follow-up when sufficient time has elapsed and prompt by asking questions such as – I thought we should be doing task x or y right about now, what is the latest status on this?I always thank my colleagues each time they keep me in the loop about upcoming deadlines, assignments and priorities.By expressing appreciation, it helps to nurture these good behaviors. i.e. using positive reinforcement.Sometimes despite your best efforts you just get blindsided and you get hit with a last minute request or deadline that means you have to drop everything you were working on and attend to the emergency. "
  When have you taken initiative at work?," In one of my former jobs as an Operations Director at a non- profit organization, my primary role was setting up new operational systems, processes and procedures that would aid the daily operations and administration of donor-funded projects.In addition to my primary tasks, I decided to develop a website framework that would showcase our department, the projects that we were working on, success stories from the field and upcoming events and announcements.I compiled all the relevant project information, edited it into impactful language, selected the best photographs from a library of hundreds of photos and matched them with relevant articles.I then scheduled time with the organization’s Website Manager and together we developed a fully functioning website for our projects.This became the model for other departments within the organization and they also adopted and replicated the website framework to showcase their work. "
  How would you ensure that customers are happy?," In my role as a Corporate Travel Agent, my job entails booking the most efficient, cost effective and shortest route possible for busy international corporate executives.Whenever I am assigned a new client, I take time to schedule an introductory meeting where I introduce myself.I also learn about the specific executive’s preferred airline carriers, connections, hubs, maximum layover time, cities they would like to connect through or not connect through, airport shuttle preference, average frequency of flights per month, preferred hotels, frequent flyer program etc.I then program this information on a database and each time the executive needs to take a flight, I rapidly customize the entire flight experience based on their preferences and within the customer’s budget.As a result of my attention to detail and personalized customer service, our portfolio of clients has been steadily increasing.Our clients usually refer other executives to our company.Moreover, I consistently get high customer satisfaction ratings from my assigned clients during quarterly customer satisfaction surveys. "
  How do you prioritize tasks?," In my job as a Procurement Specialist my role involves managing critical purchasing deadlines from multiple departments, communicating with hundreds of suppliers and resolving purchasing issues.On a daily basis I write down a to-do list of all my tasks.I write my list on spreadsheets with different tabs for each day.I then go through the list and identify high priority items which have upcoming deadlines.I also have a daily check-in meeting with my boss to learn her priorities and readjust my tasks accordingly.Before working on each task I mentally estimate how long it will take to complete it.When emergencies and unforeseen deadlines arise, I quickly jump to address those and reorganize my priority list accordingly.At the end of each day I review all the tasks completed and prepare a to-do list for the following day. "
  How do you work under pressure?," I am able to work well both under pressure and without pressure.In my job as a Flight Attendant, my primary aim is to offer outstanding service and keep passengers comfortable at all times so that they can enjoy their flights.I am able to remain calm and offer instructions, guidance and reassurance during non-emergency and emergency situations such as directing passengers during evacuation emergencies.I exhibit a pleasant and cordial demeanor even while working in-flight in tight conditions for long periods.Likewise, I work cheerfully during less stressful parts of the job such as greeting and welcoming passengers aboard a flight.One particular flight a few months ago was extra stressful because one of my fellow Flight Attendants became sick during a 10-hour flight and had to rest.As a result we were short-staffed as we attended to hundreds of passengers on the flight and had a heavier than normal workload.I rose to the occasion by responding as fast as I could to requests from passengers while still maintaining a pleasant demeanor.I pushed up the meal serving schedules to ensure that we served all the passengers in a timely manner while attending to their other individualized requests. "
  How do you resolve disagreements with co-workers?," When I encounter a disagreement with a co-worker or when we are not seeing eye-to-eye, I typically aim to resolve it as soon as possible.I would normally find an opportunity to privately speak with my colleague.I then respectfully highlight the issue or problem and listen to my colleague’s point of view.Afterwards we work on finding common ground on how we can move forward amicably.At the back of my mind I usually remind myself to stay calm and avoid being defensive or argumentative. "

  How would your former boss describe you?," My former boss would describe me as being dependable, meticulous and forward-thinking.I always exhibited a  can-do  attitude and my boss regularly relied on me to push through tasks that others did not like doing.When assigned projects, I ensured that I had as much information as needed and always pushed myself to deliver accurate and high-quality work.

I know that XYZ Company has Feedback Friday lunches with interested employees once a month, and I really love that. Communication and transparency are really important to me, too."
How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?,"In stressful situations, I do my best to stay calm and focus on a solution. For example, when I was the features editor at my college newspaper, I had writers fail to make deadline a few times. Instead of panicking, I approached the problem calmly and wrote the articles myself. Later, I sat down with each writer and we came up with a plan so that wouldn’t happen again. In time, I didn’t have to deal with that type of stress again because we’d addressed what caused it."
Who was the most difficult person you ever worked with?,"I had a challenging lab partner last year. He was disorganized, and we kept missing deadlines because he didn’t update me on his progress. Eventually, I insisted on weekly, in-person check-ins to stay on track. He found it annoying at first, but we got the work done, and in the end, we walked away on good terms. !@#@!  It was the first day of my boss’s two-week vacation and our agency’s highest-paying client threatened to leave because he didn’t feel he was getting the personalised service he was promised. I spent my lunch hour on the phone with him talking through his concerns. We even brainstormed ideas for his next campaign.

How would your professors/friends/co-workers describe you?,The other members of student council might say that I’m an extremely effective leader as president.

What was the most difficult decision you have made in your past life?," After completing my graduation, the toughest decision is whether to go for higher studies or do a job. Then I chose the job because getting trained is better than educated and it was also the demand of that time.  !@#@!  My toughest decision was to take admission in B.tech. I belong to a middle-class family, and my father was not in favor of taking admission, but I convinced him, and today he is very happy.  !@#@!

What was the biggest mistake of your life?," I think the worst mistake I ever made at work was in my first ever job - five years ago now. A more senior member of the team seemed to take an instant dislike to me from the start, and one day she was particularly unpleasant to me in front of several colleagues. Later on, I was talking to one of those colleagues who was, I thought, attempting to console me. Angry and hurt, I foolishly vented my feelings and told her what I thought of the lady in question. I was naturally shocked to find out that she went on to tell everyone what I had said and this certainly didn't help my relationship with the team member who was causing me problems. Rather than let the situation carry on, I chose to have a quiet word with this lady to find out what her problem was with me and to see if we could put it behind us. It turned out it was nothing personal; she just resented the fact that a friend of hers had also been interviewed for my position and had been turned down. Once we had got matters out into the air, her behavior changed, and we got on quite well after that. However, I certainly learned a lot from experience. I learned that careful communication is vital in managing interpersonal relationships and that if I have a problem with someone, it's always best to talk it over with them rather than with someone else. "
Do you have any reference?, yes  !@#@!  no 
How do you deal with an angry or irritated customer?," I would try to find out exactly what the problem was, and evaluate if there was something I could do to make it right.  !@#@!

If that problem is not regarding my work area, I spoke to someone who could help him immediately. "
Explain the difference between group and team?," There is only one difference between the group and the team. That is unity. Any set of people who stand together without any purpose or goal can be called as Group. Whereas, when more than 2 people work towards a common goal, can be called as a Team.

In a team, the members will cooperate and coordinate with each other at all times. "
