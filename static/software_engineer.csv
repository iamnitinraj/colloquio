Explain how new data can be inserted into the tree?,"The following are the steps that you need to follow to insert the data into the tree: First of all, check whether the data is unique or not ( i.e. check whether the data that you are going to insert doesn’t already exist in the tree). Then check if the tree is empty. If the tree is empty then all you need to do is just insert a new item into the root.  If the key is smaller than that of a root’s key then insert that data into the root’s left subtree or otherwise, insert the data into the right side of the root’s subtree.",,
